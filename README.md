Hotel Booking Data Analysis on Python
This project is a data analysis exploration of hotel booking data using Python. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science enthusiasts and professionals.

Overview
The hospitality industry relies heavily on data analysis to understand customer behaviour, optimize pricing strategies, and improve overall operations. 
This project aims to provide insights into hotel booking patterns, guest preferences, and other key factors that influence booking decisions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about hotel bookings, including:

Booking details such as arrival date, departure date, and number of guests.
Customer demographics such as nationality, age, and gender.
Reservation details include room type, meal type, and booking channel.
Cancellation status.
Analysis
The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The following key aspects are explored:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset, including data distribution, missing values, and outliers.
Booking Patterns: Analyzing booking trends over time, including seasonal variations, booking lead time, and length of stay.
Customer Segmentation:     Identifying distinct customer segments based on demographics and booking behaviour.
Cancellation Analysis:     Investigating factors influencing booking cancellations, such as lead time, booking channel, and room type.
                           Revenue Optimization: Exploring strategies to optimize hotel revenue through pricing analysis and demand forecasting.
